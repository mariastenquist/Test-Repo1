###How's it going? 
* Things are pretty good over here. Up kinda late, cuz I'm still *jetlagged*. I'll get over it soon :) 

####My favorite travel food blog is probably Legal Nomads by Jodi Ettenburg.
* I met her in Portland--she is awesome. [http://www.legalnomads.com]

#####Hmm, let's make a list. 
* Gonna choose an acronym that is on every pilot's checklist prior to landing: it's called CGUMPS.

1. Carb Heat
2. Fuel Selector 
3. Undercarriage
4. Mixture
5. Power
6. Safety Belts

######Ciao for now!!!
